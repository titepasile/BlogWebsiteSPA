# projektBlogWebsite

This is a blog website, which I started to develop with duckud. You can see the old version on her profile. I am going to make a SPA out of it with a NoSQL database for the backend. At the end it's going to have a login and a registration site. You are going to be able to create a Blog, which is a sort of text you can design with pictures and different fonds. A special feature this website has is our "Take a break" site. It was duckuds idea to develop a subpage with you can listen to music and relax or play mini games for some fun during the work.
